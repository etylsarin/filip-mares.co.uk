## Goal of the project

Create an attractive micro site of the DHL benefit program with customer preferences for the endorsement of sales and construction of the brand DHL. Addressing and acquiring new customers in the domain of offered services.

## Description of the solution

We created successful creative web contests connected to the ordering of presents, for two years. A large-scale backend for the administering of users and on-line system actualization of the points earned in the database for using client services was created. For additional attractiveness we added a FLASH game and knowledge contests.

## My work on this project

I cooperated on preparing the design of the pages and FLASH components using XML and ActionScript. After that I prepared the templates of the pages using the standards: XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0 with emphasis on schematics and validity of the code.
