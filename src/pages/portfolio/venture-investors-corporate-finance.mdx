## Goal of the project

The client wanted a new design and identity for an existing site that was professional and conservative as well as engaging, which could highlight the fact that this is the premiere Investment banking company.

## Description of the solution

The challenge for this project was to create a design, which was both elegant and visually engaging, but at the same time simple and intuitive to use. Working only from a supplied logo, all the structure and the copy were revised, based on SEO analysis, to better introduce the company and offered services to a relevant audience.

## My work on this project

While working as a freelancer, I was responsible for creating a new design for this site from the ground up, as well as all production work to bring the new design to life. I also served as a technical consultant, recommending different ways in which the site's information could be displayed. The site was done in solid HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
