## Goal of the project

Create an attractive corporate and intranet site following client's Graphic Standards Manual. The design should look bright and modern, following all the latest trends in web design and benefit from rich progressive enhancements improving user's experience.

## Description of the solution

Based on a wider discussion with client and his marketing agency we created static page templates according to their marketing strategy. The second stage was mostly technical - we had to apply our templates to client's CMS solution and provide cross browser testing.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a lead interface developer. My role was to set up the project, cooperate with designers and experience architects, create the main template as well as the functional core for progressive enhancements. After that I was supervising and make sure that the quality was of a certain standard.
