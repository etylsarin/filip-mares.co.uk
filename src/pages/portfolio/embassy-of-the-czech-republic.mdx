**Ministry of Foreign Affairs Czech Republic - **

## Goal of the project

Our client wanted a complete overhaul of the existing websites, including new representative multilingual design, search engine optimization, updated structure and navigation, all to unify the Internet look of all Czech Embassies around the world.

## Description of the solution

In response to client request to update their web sites following the specific needs, the analysis and early design iterations were made. After client comments had been implemented, the final design was signed off and the static page templates were built in solid HTML and CSS. Close attention was paid to validity, accessibility and user experience.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a contractor. I was responsible for the creation and development of the site's new look and feel, as well as the production of all page templates using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with emphasis on schematics, validity and accessibility of the code.
