## Goal of the project

Create a redesign of the previous website with emphasis on clarity, accessibility and user experience as well as front-end performance. The design should look lightweight, bright and modern, following the trends of other European public transport websites.

## Description of the solution

The main challenge in this case was to design the rich content page in an easy-to-read and easy-to-use fashion and structure the content by its importance for an ordinary visitor. Special attention was paid to navigation elements allowing users efficient and intuitive movement across the site.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a freelancer. I created graphics design as well as the basic page template using the following standards: XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0 with emphasis on schematics, validity and accessibility of the code.
