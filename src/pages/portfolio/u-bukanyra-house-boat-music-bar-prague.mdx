## Goal of the project

Create a redesign of the old website which would better correspond with the fact that this club is quite unique - it's situated on a boat. Provide visitors the best possible information about events and the club itself.

## Description of the solution

In this particular case, Wordpress was chosen as the best possible platform due to it's easy management capabilities. The colours and design used should evoke a buccaneerish feel. The structure of the website was enriched by new sections to create a more community like environment with emphasis on SEO.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a freelancer. I started from the scratch with a graphics design. After it had been signed off by client I set up Wordpress and prepared the basic page template. Avoiding any data loss, I designed a data bridge to transfer the old data structure to the new Wordpress's database.
