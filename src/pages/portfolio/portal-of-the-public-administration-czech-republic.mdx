## Goal of the project

Create a multilingual website with a clearly defined structure, which would aggregate all official information about Czech Republic. The site should help citizens as well as foreigners who want to live or start a company in the Czech Republic.

## Description of the solution

The challenge for this project was to design a rich content page in an easy-to-read and easy-to-use fashion and structure the content by its importance for all its audience. Close attention was paid to all navigation elements allowing visitors quick and intuitive movement across the whole portal.

## My work on this project

While working as a freelancer, I was asked to create a graphical design for this project. It was a really challenging job because I had just a few days to finish it. I came up with a design benefiting from its simplicity, clarity and intuitive usage.
