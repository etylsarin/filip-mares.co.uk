## Goal of the project

Design a logotype and create a website with emphasis on visitor's rich visual experience. The design should look lightweight, modern and credible, maximizing the conversion rate between visitors and customers.

## Description of the solution

The logotype should represent exclusivity combined with tradition. The website was designed with a simple but intelligible site structure to present the rich visual content supplied by client. A special attention was paid to call to action phrases leading visitor to the registration form page.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a freelancer. Started from scratch with a logotype designs. After one had been chosen and signed off by client I moved on to the web design and basic page templates using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with emphasis on schematics and validity of the code.
