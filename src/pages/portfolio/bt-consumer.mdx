## Goal of the project

We were asked to redesign and provide ongoing optimisation of BT.com. This covered a wide variety of areas, from the Sales area to self-service, order journeys and blogs/content areas. The goal was to move away from equally targeting several audiences to primarily targeting consumers.

## Description of the solution

Agile-based project where objectives were agreed for each iteration. The project covered the whole of BT.com and could vary per iteration depending on the client's requirements. Deliverables could be simple page templates, arrangements for multi variant testing or more complex JavaScript or API integration. At the same time, we were responsible for ensuring that the platform was optimised as much as possible and that the codebase continued to advance in terms of accessibility and industry standards.

## My work on this project

As a part of LBi London I was one of two tech leads. This has involved working closely with clients, colleagues in different disciplines and third parties. Was also responsible for creating flat HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates to be delivered to the client. Aside from that I made input into planning and estimations for timing of deliverables.
