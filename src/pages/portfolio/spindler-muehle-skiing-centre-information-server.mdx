## Goal of the project

Create an informative portal to support tourism in Spindler Muehle town and the surrounding skiing area. Tourists should easily find any relevant information e.g. weather conditions, prices of accommodation and sport centres, opening hours etc.

## Description of the solution

Based on analysis of similar portals I suggested an update for the navigation structure. I also created a home page design to present the content supplied by client and fed in few simple modules. The idea was to change the content, modules or whole design according to season to fulfil actual visitor's expectations.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a freelancer. The client got about five various designs from several designers. My design hadn't been chosen in this case.
