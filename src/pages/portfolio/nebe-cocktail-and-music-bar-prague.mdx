## Goal of the project

Create a brand new stylish design, which would attract tourists, who come enjoy Prague centre, to one of the bars in this new chain.

## Description of the solution

It was decided to use a simple but intelligible site structure to present the content supplied by client in a well structured way for users as much as search engines. The colours and designs used should correspond with bar's pleasant atmosphere and stylish interior.

## My work on this project

I worked on this project as a freelancer. I was responsible for creating a new look and feel for the site, as well as all front-end production work to bring the new design to life using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with emphasis on schematics, validity and SEO.
