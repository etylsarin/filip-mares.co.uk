## Goal of the project

Create a multilingual redesign of the previous website which would attract locals as well as tourists, who come to enjoy Prague centre using it's content and appearance.

## Description of the solution

It was decided to use a simple but intelligible site structure to present the content supplied by the client in a well structured way for users as well as for search engines. The colours and designs used should correspond with bar's pleasant atmosphere and stylish interior.

## My work on this project

For this project, where I worked as a freelancer, I was responsible for both the overall creative design of the site, as well as its technical development and production, which was done in solid HTML, JavaScript and CSS with emphasis on schematics, validity of the code and SEO.
