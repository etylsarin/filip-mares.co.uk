## Goal of the project

To redesign and re-platform the Unilever.com site using JavaScript-driven complex behaviour and creative HTML coding to present an engaging, interactive experience to its visitors.

## Description of the solution

Writing new HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the front-end, to integrate with new JSP templates on the backend. Most of the high-level pages were brand new code, but care had to be taken with lower level pages where we had to implement a new design on top of older HTML with new CSS.

## My work on this project

As a part of LBi London I was one of a two-man team. We were responsible for all front-end production utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Flash. A special attention was paid on mark up validity and accessible fallbacks for all Flash and JavaScript functionality.
